# Merge sort

This is the type of sorting when we split an array into two
subarrays. Then, if the length of the subarrays is greater 
than 1, we repeat this for each subarray. In another case, 
we merge subarrays. 

Merging is when we create the resulting array and, step by
step, pop the smallest element from the two subarrays 
and insert it into the end of resulting array.
